Play the game live at ``https://immense-beach-69325.herokuapp.com/``

Or to play it locally run ``https://github.com/rohan-paul/Card-Matching-Memory-Game.git`` and then just open the home.html file with a browser.

How the game is played - Click on each box, and the image will be revealed. For each image, there's a duplicate of the same. As you click on 2 same images both will vanish. Goal is to match all images in the lowest possible time.
